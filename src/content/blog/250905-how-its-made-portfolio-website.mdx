Time to talk about how my retro video-game inspired portfolio website was made!

I had a ton of fun building this over the last couple of months, but that wasn't
always the case. I started it in 2023 but was struggling to find the motivation
to keep building it. I was originally going to build a run-of-the-mill
corporate-style resume-as-HTML website but it just felt like a slog. That
changed earlier this year when I had a ðŸ’¡ moment and realized it doesn't have to
be a boring corporate website if I built it around something I am passionate
about, retro video games, and that epiphany helped me build it from start to
finish in the last 4 months.

I thought it would be fun to look back at all the iterations of the website
through the magic of version control and see how it evolved. If you are also a
developer, you should probably also have your own portfolio website. Your
passion doesn't have to be retro video games, but I hope this will give you some
inspiration to find your own passion and motivation to start building it!

# Inspirations

I grew up in the late 90s and early 2000s and love video games from that era -
specifically GBA, PS1, and PS2. Is it fair to call those "retro" now? Anyway,
something about the look and feel of games from that era (the **soul**, so to
speak) is very nostalgic to me, so I thought it would be really fun to build my
portfolio website and mimic some visual elements from games of that generation.
I had 4 main inspirations:

- [**Mega Man Battle Network**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_Battle_Network)
- [**Metal Gear Solid**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_(1998_video_game)>)
- [**Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_and_Sapphire)
- [**Signalis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalis) - Not technically a
  retro game being that it released in 2022, but its influences (Resident Evil
  and Silent Hill) and visuals obviously call back to that era.

I found myself spending a lot of time watching videos of these 4 games and
constantly referring back to them for inspiration as I was building the website
to try to capture their **soul**. If you are familiar with any of these games, I
hope you caught some references in the home page, but I'll point them out in the
sections below too.

I hope it's obvious that this one is a reference to title drops in many GBA
games. Specifically, the one in the opening intro of **Pokemon
Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald**.
