Time to talk about how my retro video-game inspired portfolio website was made!

I had a ton of fun building this over the last couple of months, but that wasn't
always the case. I started it in 2023 but was struggling to find the motivation
to keep building it. I was originally going to build a run-of-the-mill
corporate-style resume-as-HTML website but it just felt like a slog. That
changed earlier this year when I had a ðŸ’¡ moment and realized it doesn't have to
be a boring website if I built it around something I am passionate about - retro
video games - and that epiphany helped me build it from start to finish in the
last 4 months.

I thought it would be fun to look back at all the iterations of the website
through the magic of version control and see how it evolved. If you are also a
developer, you should probably also have your own portfolio website. Your
passion doesn't have to be retro video games, but I hope this will give you some
inspiration to find your own passion and motivation to start building it!

# Inspirations

I grew up in the late 90s and early 2000s and love video games from that era -
specifically GBA, PS1, and PS2. Is it fair to call those "retro" now? Something
about the look and feel of games from that era (the **soul**, so to speak) is
very nostalgic to me, so I thought it would be really fun to build my portfolio
website and mimic some visual elements from games of that generation. I had 4
main inspirations:

- [**Mega Man Battle Network**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_Battle_Network)
- [**Metal Gear Solid**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_(1998_video_game)>)
- [**Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_and_Sapphire)
- [**Signalis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalis) - Not technically a
  retro game since it released in 2022, but its influences (Resident Evil and
  Silent Hill) and visuals obviously call back to that era.

I found myself spending a lot of time looking at screenshots and videos of these
4 games and constantly referring back to them for inspiration as I was building
the website to try to capture their _je ne sais quoi_. If you are familiar with
any of these games, I hope you caught some references on the home page, but I'll
point them out in the sections below too.

# Iterations and Lessons Learned

# The Tech Stack

I eventually settled on the tech stack below:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with the App Router and using
  [Static Exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/static-exports) to deploy
  as a static site
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling (with some CSS modules
  sprinkled in for more complex CSS)
- [Motion](https://motion.dev/) for a couple fancy animations
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for blog articles like this one written in Markdown
- [giscus](https://giscus.app/) for comment sections in blog posts
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to build and
  [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the static site
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for testing components in isolation
- and a special shoutout to
  [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames), such a simple but
  flexible utility that opens up so many advanced styling options.

So far, this works quite well and covers all my needs!

### Hero

![Hero](/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-portfolio-website/hero.png)

The hero section, the big, bold banner at the top of a website whose only job is
to make an impact. First impressions are everything!

This one is a reference to title drops in many retro games. Specifically, mine
is inspired by the opening intro of **Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald**.

The subtle 3D text effect and shine rolling over it made me really want to
recreate it, and the hero section was a perfect fit.

The effect is actually really simple - it's just a combination of
`transform: perspective()` for the 3D effect and a very specific
`background: linear-gradient()` for that glossy, reflective shine.

<div className="full-width">
  <div
    className="codepen"
