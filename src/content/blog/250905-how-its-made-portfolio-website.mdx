Time to talk about how my retro video game-inspired portfolio website was made!

I had a ton of fun building this over the last couple of months, but that wasn't
always the case. I started it in 2023 but was struggling to find the motivation
to keep building it. I was originally going to build a run-of-the-mill
corporate-style resume-as-HTML website but it just felt like a slog. That
changed earlier this year when I had a ðŸ’¡ moment and realized it doesn't have to
be a boring website if I built it around something I am passionate about - retro
video games - and that epiphany helped me build it from start to finish in the
last 4 months.

I thought it would be fun to look back at all the iterations of the website
through the magic of version control and see how it evolved. If you are also a
developer, you should probably also have your own portfolio website. Your
passion doesn't have to be retro video games, but I hope this will give you some
inspiration to find your own passion and motivation to start building it!

# Inspirations

I grew up in the late 90s and early 2000s and love video games from that era -
specifically GBA, PS1, and PS2. Is it fair to call those "retro" now? Something
about the look and feel of games from that era (the **soul**, so to speak) is
super nostalgic to me, so I thought it would be fun to mimic some visual
elements from games of that generation in my portfolio website. I had 4 main
inspirations:

- [**Mega Man Battle Network**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_Battle_Network)
- [**Metal Gear Solid**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_(1998_video_game)>)
- [**Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_and_Sapphire)
- [**Signalis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalis) - Not technically a
  retro game since it released in 2022, but its influences (Resident Evil and
  Silent Hill) and visuals obviously call back to that era.

I found myself spending a lot of time looking at screenshots and videos of these
4 games and constantly referring back to them for inspiration as I was building
the website to try to capture their _je ne sais quoi_. If you are familiar with
any of these games, I hope you caught some references on the home page, but I'll
point some of them out in the sections below too.

Aside from those, I also bookmarked a couple of other personal websites that
caught my eye to use as references:

- [Dead Simple Sites](https://deadsimplesites.com/) - A lot of great examples
  here and I found myself coming back to this over and over and then simplifying
  my own design to avoid clutter.
- [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) - the holy grail of personal
  websites in my opinion. I love all the micro-interactions and easter eggs
  sprinkled all over all while maintaining a simple and minimalist design. I
  definitely took a few notes from it for my own website.

# Iterations and Lessons Learned

# The Tech Stack

I eventually settled on the tech stack below:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with the App Router and using
  [Static Exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/static-exports) to deploy
  as a static site
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling (with some CSS modules
  sprinkled in for more complex CSS)
- [Motion](https://motion.dev/) for a couple fancy animations
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for blog articles like this one written in Markdown
- [giscus](https://giscus.app/) for comment sections in blog posts
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to build and
  [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the static site
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for testing components in isolation
- and a special shoutout to
  [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames), such a simple but
  flexible utility that opens up so many advanced styling options.

So far, this works quite well and covers all my needs!

## Boot Sequence

![Boot Sequence](/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-portfolio-website/boot.png)

I wasn't able to find a name for this trope
([Activation Sequence](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActivationSequence)
and
[Diegetic Interface](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiegeticInterface)
come close) but I noticed a lot of video games, especially ones that try to go
for a retro feel, include a fake operating system boot sequence with references
to some in-universe brand/company. This shows up in both **Signalis** (also note
the colour scheme, more on that below) and **Metal Gear Solid 2**.

<div className="full-width two-columns">
  <YouTubeEmbed videoId="XJPqmHEjkjE" params="start=92&end=135" />
  <YouTubeEmbed videoId="QygyxIlfDlw" params="end=20" />
</div>

This was the perfect opportunity to introduce my very own **shevtsod
Corporation** and **shevtsodOS** operating system.

One little detail you may have missed is that the browser tab's title goes
through a boot sequence too. Check it out again at

### Hero

![Hero](/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-portfolio-website/hero.png)

The hero section - the big, bold banner at the top of a website whose only job
is to make an impact. First impressions are everything! This one is a reference
to title drops in many retro games. Specifically, mine is inspired by the
opening intro of **Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald**.

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="shUkq1sfSyU" params="start=47&end=72" />

The subtle 3D text effect and shine rolling over it made me really want to
recreate it, and the hero section was a perfect fit.

The effect is really simple - it's just a combination of
`transform: perspective()` for the 3D effect and a very specific
`background: linear-gradient()` for that sharp glossy shine.

<div className="full-width">
  <div
    className="codepen"
    data-height="600"
    data-default-tab="result,css"
    data-slug-hash="MYaZgwY"
    data-pen-title="hero"
    data-user="shevtsod"
  />

I hope it's obvious that this one is straight out of **Metal Gear Solid**.

I just re-created the codec call pixel art but with the website's red theme and
replace Snake and the colonel with my own mug and your mysterious anonymous
face. A few carefully timed CSS animations let me show the "CALL" notification
and a quick call to action that looks like a message from me to you.

## Blog

I wanted to have my very own blog for a long time, and I finally get to have
one! It's powered by [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and I find it extremely powerful
to be able to write blog posts (like this one!) in the lightweight Markdown
syntax but still have the flexibility to insert any custom JSX (including any
React component).

A few of my favourite features of my blog are:

- Reading progress bars that get added to the header.
- Tables of content that stick to the right-hand side on larger devices and
  highlight the current section.
- Using frontmatter to set blog post metadata, set a hero image, and publish
  posts.

- Code blocks like the one above that were a perfect chance to re-use my
  pixelated skills icons!

# Next Steps

- An RSS feed and a sitemap
- Search/filter blog posts by tags
- Dive into [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and add some low-poly PS1-era 3D
  graphics
