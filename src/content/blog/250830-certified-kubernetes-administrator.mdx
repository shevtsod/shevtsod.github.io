I passed the CKA exam earlier this week with **92%**! It was my first cert and I
think I way over-prepared for it because it was easier than expected. I use
Kubernetes at work for about a year now, so I did have some experience to fall
back on. I'd still say the biggest contributors to my success were my study
materials and practice. I thought I'd share some tips and resources that helped
me study while it's still fresh in my mind.

# Taking the Exam

The exam is entirely practical and involves completing tasks in a virtual
environment, so there is no need to prepare for MCQs. It is taken online via the
PSI platform and proctored remotely by sharing your screen, webcam, and
microphone.

I'll try to describe my experience of the day of the exam to give an idea of
what to expect.

- I scheduled it 2 weeks in advance. Fridays seem to be popular because my
  preferred time slots were already taken whereas other days were still mostly
  free. If you plan to take the exam on a Friday, try to schedule a few weeks
  ahead.
- The exam was **2 hours long** and consisted of **16 questions** (you may get
  between 15-20). The passing score is **66%**.
- You can start the exam 30 minutes early, but if the proctor is unavailable you
  may still need to wait until the scheduled start time. I started mine 15
  minutes early and the proctor was available.
- You only interact with the proctor via the live chat.
- My proctor allowed me to take 3 breaks which I did not expect. I was ready for
  a 2 hour sprint so I did not end up taking any breaks.
- There is a **check-in** before the exam starts. The proctor asks you to show
  your government ID, pan your webcam around the room, and show your hands and
  ears to make sure there are no forbidden items.
- The 2 hour timer started right after the check-in was completed.
- The proctor asked me to let them know when I was finished but did not interact
  with me during the exam otherwise.

# Topics

The CKA exam covers these topics according to the
[official CNCF curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum) as of August
2025:

- **Storage (10%)**
- **Workloads and Scheduling (15%)**
- **Servicing and Networking (20%)**
- **Troubleshooting (30%)**
- **Cluster Architecture, Installation and Configuration (25%)**

I suggest studying for these topics in particular based on the questions I got
on my test:

- **Storage (10%)**
  - [Create `StorageClass`, `PersistentVolumeClaim`, and `PersistentVolume` and mount as `volumes` to `Pod`s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/)
  - [Share `volumes` between multiple `containers` in a `Pod`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-volume-storage/)
- **Workloads and Scheduling (15%)**
  - [Create `ConfigMap`s and `Secret`s and use their values in `Pod`s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/)
  - [Configure `resources` for `Pod`s to specify CPU and RAM requests/limits for `containers`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)
  - [Use a `PriorityClass` to prioritize which `Pod`s to schedule and evict](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/#priorityclass)
  - [Create `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`s to scale `Deployment`s, `StatefulSet`s, etc. by usage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/)
- **Servicing and Networking (20%)**
  - [Create `Service`s to expose `Pod`s within and outside the cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
  - [Create an `Ingress` to expose `Service`s outside the cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
  - [Migrate from `Ingress` to `Gateway` and `HttpRoute` to expose `Service`s outside the cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/)
  - [Use a `NetworkPolicy` to limit network traffic between `Pod`s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
- **Troubleshooting (30%)**
  - [Format, filter, and sort output from `kubectl` (e.g., `-o jsonpath`, `--sort-by`, etc.)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)
  - [Troubleshoot `kubeadm` clusters, particularly static pods and other configuration files under `/etc/kubernetes`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/implementation-details/#constants-and-well-known-values-and-paths)
- **Cluster Architecture, Installation and Configuration (25%)**
  - [Install a Container Runtime (CRI)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/)
  - [Install a Networking Addon (CNI) and know the differences between the popular addons](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/#networking-and-network-policy)
  - [Install, customize, and troubleshoot Helm charts](https://helm.sh/)

I **did not** encounter the topics below that are commonly suggested to study:

- [Kustomize](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/)
- [etcd](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/)
- [Assign pods to nodes (e.g., `nodeAffinity`, `podAffinity`, etc.)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/)
- [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (e.g., `Role`, `RoleBinding`, `ServiceAccount`, etc.)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
- [CoreDNS and automatic DNS records](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/)
- [Upgrade `kubadm` clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/)

Keep in mind these could still show up on your exam. These topics are good to
know either way and I have absolutely encountered them professionally.

# Resources

These are the two resources I used to prepare for the exam:

- [**Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests | Udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/)
  - Popularly known as the "KodeKloud course" and "Mumshad's course".
  - I took it last year when I started using Kubernetes at work and thought it
    was a great introduction.
  - there are often coupons that drastically reduce the price like most Udemy
    courses.
  - It also came with a coupon for the CKA exam so getting both the course and
    exam at a discount ended up cheaper than buying just the exam.
  - It was updated with content covering the February 2025 exam refresh.
- [**Killer Shell**](https://killer.sh/)
  - Mock exams that are **nearly identical** to the PSI platform used for the
    actual CKA exam, both in terms of the questions asked and the virtual
    environment.
  - You get access to 2 simulators for 36 (consecutive) hours each for free with
    a purchase of the CKA exam.

Both of the above are paid resources, but there are plenty of free ones as well.
I recommend checking out the [r/CKAExam](https://www.reddit.com/r/CKAExam/)
subreddit to read about other people's experiences and resources.

# Tips & Advice

Here are some tips that helped me with the exam. Some are from advice I read
online, some from my own experience, and some are just general tips that are
useful for any exam.

- **My single biggest piece of advice: <u>do all 3 mock exams in Mumshad's
  course and both the Killer Shell simulators and go over the solutions
  after</u>**.

  The questions in these mock exams are nearly identical to the actual exam, so
  they are worth it for that alone. Plus, they help you practice under time
  pressure and the Killer Shell simulators mimic the PSI platform, so it feels
  like doing the actual exam.

- You have 2 hours to solve about 16 questions, so plan to spend about 7.5
  minutes per question and check the timer between each question to control your
  pace.
  - Don't get stunlocked on a question! If it takes you over 10 minutes to
    solve, **just move on!** It's better to fail one question than not get to
    even attempt all the ones after.

- You get partial credits for just creating the resources. It is always better
  to submit something than to skip questions completely.

- You will often be asked to create a resource with a specific name in a
  specific namespace (they give you weird names like `spline-reticulator`). The
  PSI platform lets you click the name to copy-paste it. Always do this instead
  of typing the names manually because if you have a typo and put the resource
  in the wrong place you won't even get partial credit.

- Review your answer to each question and try to catch errors **before moving to
  the next question** and not at the end of the exam. You may not have time for
  a final review, so you can at least be sure you reviewed each question once if
  you do this. If you do have time left at the end, perfect, review again.

- Know your way around the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).
  You will have access to these docs (sans discussions) and the
  [Gateway API docs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) during the exam. I posted
  links in the <a href="#topics">Topics</a> section that I remember using in my
  exam. Make sure you know how to find these.
  - Pro-tip: Use `CTRL+F` and search `kind:` to quickly jump to an example of a
    manifest to copy for the resource you are looking for as they tend to be
    scattered in different places on each page.

- Review the
  [Important Instructions: CKA and CKAD](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/tips-cka-and-ckad)
  to see what the PSI environment is preconfigured with.
  - `kubectl` with the `k` alias, `vim` and `nano` text editors, and even
    [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) are all pre-installed (which I hear was
    not the case previously).
  - As a rule of thumb, anything that worked on the Killer Shell simulators also
    worked in the PSI environment.

- Become very good at `kubectl`
  - Learn imperative commands to quickly create resources (e.g., `kubectl run`,
    `kubectl create secret`, `kubectl create deploy`) and be aware of some
    exceptions that cannot be created with the CLI (e.g., `PersistentVolume`).
  - Use imperative commands to scaffold a resource and append
    `--dry-run=client -o yaml > manifest.yaml` to save it as a temporary file
    and add any properties that cannot be added from the CLI, then use
    `kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml` to deploy the resource.
  - Learn JSONPath to extract fields from resources with `-o jsonpath`.
  - Don't wait for `Pod`s to exit when deleting them, kill them to save time.

    ```shell
    kubectl delete pod my-pod --grace-period 0 --force
    ```

- Each question will ask you to SSH into a different machine like
  `ssh cka000001`. Make sure you don't answer the question on the wrong machine
  or you won't get credit for it!
- Use the correct namespace either with `kubectl -n namespace` or
  `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace namespace`.
- There is always at least one "troubleshooting" question that is worded
  something like:

  > The cluster has an issue and is not working properly. Investigate and fix
  > the issue.

  **As soon as you see this question, immediately flag it and move on to the
  others and leave this one for last**. Why? Because this kind of question can
  feel like finding a needle in a haystack and can take significantly longer to
  solve than the other tasks that are more straightforward. The "issue" you need
  to solve could just be a typo in any manifest in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`
  and you need to carefully read logs and each manifest to try and locate the
  error.

  I realized this when I took one of the mock exams and spent over 15 minutes on
  this question. This made me lose focus since I could not figure it out and I
  had to rush the other questions as a result. It'll feel much less stressful if
  you finish the other questions first and then go back to this one with 15-30
  minutes left on the timer. 😉

- Try to come up with a comfortable "layout" and spend the first 1-2 minutes of
  the exam just setting up your workspace the way you want it. I personally had
  a terminal at the top left, web browser bottom right, and VSCodium bottom left
  for notes.

- Make sure to carefully read and prepare for the
  [exam rules and policies](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/tc-docs/certification/lf-handbook2/exam-rules-and-policies).
  The proctor can be **very** nitpicky during the check-in and will ask you
  about every little item they notice during your room scan. This may not seem
  like a big deal, but if you are laser focused and ready to start the exam,
  this will delay it and throw you off, so you really want to get through this
  as fast as possible.
  - I have a lot of crap on my desk (multiple monitors, studio microphone, game
    consoles, etc.) that would be impractical to tear down for the test and then
    put back together, so I set up a separate desk with a laptop on the other
    side of the room for the test. The proctor seemed to really not like my main
    desk in the background and asked me a lot of questions about it. I reassured
    them multiple times that I had everything turned off but, in hindsight, I
    should've just covered it all with a bed sheet.
  - Use an external webcam if you can. It's less of a hassle to pan around than
    an entire laptop.
- If you use Kubernetes professionally, consider waiting a few months to take
  the CKA exam to get some hands-on experience first. Otherwise, consider using
  platforms like [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/) to practice with a
  virtual cluster. Hands-on experience helped me deal with certain situations
  faster than I would if I encountered them for the first time on the exam.

- You get a free retake so don't sweat it if the first attempt doesn't go well!

## Advice to Avoid

There is also some common advice I read online that **I disagree with and would
avoid**:

- I read a lot of horror stories about the PSI environment being laggy,
  unresponsive, and difficult to work with. It worked just fine for me and was
  **exactly** like the Killer Shell simulators. I am located in North America,
  though, and I suppose it might be worse in other regions.
- No, you don't need to be a master of `vim`, `nano`, or whatever other text
  editor. I read a lot of advice about optimizing `vim` settings and mastering
  hotkeys. Don't waste time on any of that and focus on studying for the exam
  content instead. I use `vim` but don't consider myself very good at it and I
  did just fine with some basics:
  - `v` to enter visual mode and select multiple lines
  - `dd` to delete a line
  - `:x` to save and exit

  I even moved the cursor and indented one character at a time and still
  finished the exam with 10 minutes to spare.

- Same as above for other speed optimizations like using `tmux` and custom
  aliases. You can use them if you want, but you don't _need_ any of them.
- The whackiest advice I read was that you should really spin up your own
  cluster from scratch with
  [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)
  to **truly** be ready for the exam. Is it going to give you a really deep
  understanding of all the underlying components? Sure. Can you do well on the
  exam without it? Yep.
