Time to talk about how my retro video game-inspired portfolio website was made!

I had a ton of fun building this recently but that wasn't always the case. I
started it in 2023 but struggled to find the motivation to continue. I was
originally going for a run-of-the-mill corporate-style resume-as-HTML website
but it just felt like a slog. That changed earlier this year when I had a üí°
moment and realized it doesn't have to be just a boring website if I built it
around something that I like, like retro video games, and that epiphany helped
me build it from start to finish in the last 5 months.

I thought it would be fun to look back at all the iterations of the website
through the magic of version control and see how it evolved. I'll also share a
couple of the techniques and tricks I used.

If you are also a developer, you should probably have a personal website to show
off your work too. Your passion doesn't have to be retro video games, but I hope
this will give you some inspiration to find your own passion and the motivation
to start building it.

# Inspirations

I grew up in the late 90s and early 2000s and love games from that era -
specifically GBA, PS1, and PS2. Is it fair to call them "retro" now? Something
about the look and feel of games from that era (the **soul**, so to speak) is
super nostalgic to me, so I wanted to mimic some of their visual elements in my
personal website. I had 4 main inspirations:

- [**Mega Man Battle Network**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_Battle_Network)
- [**Metal Gear Solid**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_(1998_video_game)>)
- [**Pok√©mon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_and_Sapphire)
- [**Signalis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalis) - Not exactly retro
  since it released in 2022, but its influences (Resident Evil and Silent Hill)
  and visuals obviously call back to that era.

I found myself constantly checking screenshots and videos of these 4 games for
inspiration and to try to capture their _je ne sais quoi_. If you are familiar
with these games, I hope you caught a few references on the home page!

I also bookmarked a couple of other personal websites that caught my eye to use
as references:

- [Dead Simple Sites](https://deadsimplesites.com/) - a lot of great examples
  here that encouraged me to simplify my own design to just the essentials to
  avoid visual clutter.
- [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) - the holy grail of personal
  websites in my opinion. I love all the micro-interactions and easter eggs
  sprinkled all over all while keeping a simple and minimal look. I definitely
  took a few notes from it for my own website.

# Iterations and Lessons Learned

I checked out a few past commits to get some snapshots of how the website
evolved over time. Here's the progression starting from the very beginning.

Yes, really. üòÖ It was just my name and a link to my GitHub against a black
background. This was mostly me getting a domain, setting up a new project in
Next.js, and getting _something_ out there as a start.

  />

Still the same content as before plus a footer, but this is when I established
the (original) look and feel. I went for a design that incorporates trendy
design patterns like blurs, gradient text and backgrounds, and spring
animations. It had a bit of an Apple product marketing page vibe but it didn't
really connect with me for my personal website and I didn't end up expanding on
it much more.

This was also around when the App Router in Next.js became GA and I migrated to
it from the Pages Router which was trivial since I only had a basic layout and
one page.

![Version 3 - April 4, 2024](/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-personal-website/240404.png)
Caption: Version 3 - April 4, 2024

This was when I started experimenting with redesigning the look and feel which
eventually led me to try the retro video-game inspired design that I settled on.
It was still just the static hero and footer at this point; no content or fancy
animations yet.

A big mistake I made at this point was migrating the project to
[Vite](https://vite.dev/). My reasoning was that, since I was building a static
site, I would not use most of the features of Next.js that are geared towards
full-stack applications with dynamic content. What I didn't account for was that
I _did_ benefit greatly from the ability in Next.js to generate a
[static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/static-exports). To explain
this a bit better, let's get some acronym soup out of the way:

- **Single Page Application (`SPA`)** - your typical client-side application
  created with tools like Vite that runs entirely on one HTML page. All of its
  routing is faked using JS replacing the content of the page.
- **Static Site Generation (`SSG`)** - a technique where the application's pages
  or routes are compiled **at build time** to static HTML pages. It's supported
  by frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby, Astro, etc. My portfolio website uses this
  right now.
- **Server Side Rendering (`SSR`)** - similar to SSG but the pages are compiled
  **at request time**. This still has the benefit of producing static HTML
  instead of populating content with client-side JS, but it also allows for
  dynamic content such as the user's name and profile picture or user-specific
  content. This typically requires a framework like Node.js that runs a
  server-side daemon.
- **Search Engine Optimization (`SEO`)** - an umbrella term for techniques that
  improve a website's visibility on search engines like Google.

The reason I said it was a mistake to switch to Vite is because it only supports
SPA and
[those are atrocious for SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)
(that's not entirely true and Vite
[does offer SSR and SSG capabilities](https://vite.dev/guide/ssr) but only with
a low-level API that requires extra tooling and isn't exactly first-class). In
my case, this resulted in my app's URLs looking like this because I had to use
hash routing:

`https://shevtsod.com/#/blog`

The silly little `/#/`
[made search engines refuse to crawl my website entirely](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hash_routing).
üíÄ

That's not to say that Vite is bad and I have used it (and the legacy Create
React App) for SPAs, but for a personal website, I definitely needed SSG
instead. I ended up migrating _back_ to Next.js and this was overall a huge
waste of time but a good lesson to learn.

And that brings us to where we are today! ü•≥ Once I settled on a tech stack and
got the configuration just right (which for some reason always seems to take the
longest time), I was off to the races. Most of the website's features were built
on weekends between April and August 2025. I'll go over specific features in
more detail in the sections below.

# The Tech Stack

Here is the tech stack I eventually settled on for this project:

| Name                                                      | Purpose                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (w/ App Router)**        | React framework                                                |
| **[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)**                  | Styling (+ some CSS modules sprinkled in for more complex CSS) |
| **[Motion](https://motion.dev/)**                         | Fancy animations!                                              |
| **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)**                             | Markdown for blog posts like this one                          |
| **[giscus](https://giscus.app/)**                         | Comments for blog posts powered by GitHub                      |
| **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** | Continuous Integration and Delivery                            |
| **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**             | Hosting the static site                                        |
| **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)**                | Testing components in isolation                                |

So far, this works quite well and covers all my needs! üëç

# Design Principles

I've been careful to stick to the rules below that guided me in the design of
the website. You may have noticed some examples of these on the website if I did
a good job.

- **Colour and Contrast**
  - I love [chiaroscuro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro) and mixing
    bold, vibrant colours against dark backgrounds. I think it looks amazing on
    modern OLED displays. **Signalis** uses this masterfully and my colour
    scheme is heavily influenced by it.
- **Alignment, Balance, Negative Space, Proximity, and Repetition**
  - I try to express elements of the UI without explicit borders or separators
    which means bringing similar elements together and keeping dissimilar
    elements further apart and relying on the negative space between them to
    represent their boundaries.
- **Responsive & Mobile First**
  - In 2025, every website should scale to any device size.
- **Engaging Content**
  - Less walls of text and more visuals and micro-interactions.
- **Look and Feel**
  - Establish a theme and stick to it. I built custom components for buttons,
    icons, form fields, etc. that all fit together and the overall theme.
- **Minimalism**
  - Less is more!
- **Animation**
  - Animation is tough because its inclusion helps attract attention and
    interest but overuse leads to frustration. I took care to keep animation
    short and sweet but still noticeable which took a lot of trial-and-error.

# Techniques and Tricks

## Boot Sequence

![Boot Sequence](/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-personal-website/boot.png)

Would I ever force a 2 second splash screen on an actual website or application
if it was not necessary to cover loading? No. Would I do it to make a first
impression on my personal website? Absolutely.

I wasn't able to find a name for this trope
([Activation Sequence](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActivationSequence)
and
[Diegetic Interface](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiegeticInterface)
come close) but I noticed a lot of video games, especially ones that try to go
for a retro feel, include a fake operating system boot sequence with references
to some in-universe brand/company. This shows up in both **Signalis** and
**Metal Gear Solid 2**.

<div className="full-width two-columns">
  <YouTubeEmbed videoId="XJPqmHEjkjE" params="start=92&end=135" />
  <YouTubeEmbed videoId="QygyxIlfDlw" params="end=20" />
</div>

This was the perfect opportunity to introduce my very own **shevtsod
Corporation** and **shevtsodOS** operating system.

One little detail you may have missed is that the browser tab's title goes
through a boot sequence too. Check it out again at
[shevtsod.com](https://shevtsod.com)!

## Orchestrating Animations

## Simulating Low Framerate

## Header

<div className="full-width">
  <img
    src="/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-personal-website/logo-frames.png"
    className="w-full"
    alt="Logo sprite sheet"
  />
  Caption: The logo animation sprite sheet
</div>

The logo is actually animated! Look at it for a few seconds and it should do a
cool flip.

In the spirit of retro games, the logo animations come from the sprite sheet
above. This was a great opportunity because storing images in sprite sheets also
happens to be a classic optimization for network bandwidth in web development.
My `Logo` component uses a finite-state machine to transition between the three
different animations contained in this sprite sheet and slides through the
frames to play each animation.

## Home

### Hero

![Hero](/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-personal-website/hero.png)

The hero section - the big, bold banner at the top of a website whose only job
is to make an impact. First impressions are everything! This one is a reference
to title drops in many retro games. Specifically, mine is inspired by the
opening intro of **Pok√©mon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald**.

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="shUkq1sfSyU" params="start=47&end=72" />

The subtle 3D text effect and shine rolling over it made me really want to
recreate it, and the hero section was a perfect fit. I did tone down the
flashing colours a bit - Pok√©mon has a bit of a bad history with that.

The effect is really simple - it's just a combination of
`transform: perspective()` for the 3D effect and a very specific
`background: linear-gradient()` for that sharp glossy shine.

<div className="full-width">
  <div
    className="codepen"
    data-height="600"
    data-default-tab="result,css"
    data-slug-hash="MYaZgwY"
    data-pen-title="hero"
    data-user="shevtsod"
    data-editable="true"
  />
  <Script src="https://public.codepenassets.com/embed/index.js" />
</div>

Also, that little `SCROLL!` is inspired by the `GO!` indicator in beat'em ups
when you clear a room! üòÑ

### Summary

![Summary](/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-personal-website/summary.png)

The background is pixel art that I made inspired by **Mega Man Battle Network**.
Its overworld and battles had these repeating, scrolling backgrounds that are
kinda reminiscent of clip art on websites in the 90s. I used the
[`useScroll()`](https://motion.dev/docs/react-use-scroll) hook to give it a bit
of a parallax effect so it looks like it's further back on the page and it
starts scrolling the other way when you scroll up.

### Skills & Experience

![Skills](/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-personal-website/skills.png)

All of the icons are pixel art that I made.

### Projects

![Projects](/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-personal-website/projects.png)

The actual content in this section (and all the other sections above) is not
hardcoded in the components but stored in config files, so I can easily update
them throughout my career.

```ts:src/content/projects.ts
const projects: ProjectType[] = [
  {
    title: 'Personal Website',
    description:
      'This website, inspired by retro video games, was built to showcase projects and skills and includes a personal blog',
    promo: {
      path: '/videos/projects/480p/personal-website.mp4',
      type: 'video',
    },
    skills: ['nextjs', 'react', 'github', 'github-actions'],
    links: [
      {
        key: 'website',
        url: 'https://shevtsod.com',
      },
      {
        key: 'repository',
        url: 'https://github.com/shevtsod/shevtsod.github.io',
      },
    ],
  },
  // ...
];
```

### Contact

![Contact](/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-personal-website/contact.png)

I hope it's obvious that this one is straight out of **Metal Gear Solid**. I
just re-created the codec call pixel art but with the website's red theme and
replace Snake and the colonel with my own mug and your mysterious anonymous
face. A few carefully timed CSS animations let me show the "CALL" notification
and a quick call to action that looks like a message from me to you.

## Blog

![Blog Post](/images/blog/250905-how-its-made-personal-website/blog-post.png)

</div>

I wanted to have my very own blog for a long time, and I finally get to have
one! It's powered by [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and I find it extremely powerful
to be able to write blog posts (like this one!) in the lightweight Markdown
syntax but still have the flexibility to insert any custom JSX (including any
React component).

A few of my favourite features of my blog are:

- Reading progress bars that get added to the header.
- Tables of content that stick to the right-hand side on larger devices and
  highlight the current section.
- Using frontmatter to set blog post metadata, set a hero image, and publish
  posts.

- Code blocks like the one above that were a perfect chance to re-use my
  pixelated skills icons!

# Next Steps

It's never _perfect_ and I'm always making small tweaks, but a couple of larger
features I'd like to add at some point include:

- an RSS feed and a sitemap.
- search/filter blog posts by tags.
- dive into [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and add some low-poly PS1-era 3D
  graphics.

Thanks for stopping by! Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.
