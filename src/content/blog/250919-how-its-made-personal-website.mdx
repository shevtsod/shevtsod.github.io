Time to talk about how my retro video game-inspired portfolio website was made!

I had a ton of fun building this recently but that wasn't always the case. I
started it in 2023 but struggled to find the motivation to continue. I was
initially going for a run-of-the-mill corporate-style resume-as-HTML website but
it just felt like a slog. That changed earlier this year when I had a üí° moment
and realized it doesn't have to be just a boring website if I built it around
something that I like, like retro video games, and that epiphany helped me build
it from start to finish in the last 5 months.

I thought it would be fun to look back at all the iterations of the website
through the magic of version control and see how it evolved. I'll also share a
couple of the techniques and tricks I used.

If you are also a developer, you should probably have a personal website to show
off your work too. Your passion doesn't have to be retro games, but I hope this
will give you some inspiration to find your own passion and the motivation to
start building it.

# Inspirations

I grew up in the late 90s and early 2000s and love games from that era -
especially GBA, PS1, and PS2. Is it fair to call them "retro" now? Something
about their look and feel (the **soul**, so to speak) is super nostalgic to me,
so I wanted to mimic some of their visual elements in my personal website. I had
4 main inspirations:

- [**Mega Man Battle Network**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_Battle_Network)
- [**Metal Gear Solid**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_(1998_video_game)>)
- [**Pok√©mon Ruby, Sapphire & Emerald**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ruby_and_Sapphire)
- [**Signalis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalis) (a 2022 game so not
  exactly retro but its influences (Resident Evil and Silent Hill) and visuals
  obviously call back to that era.)

I found myself repeatedly checking screenshots and videos of these 4 games for
inspiration and to try to capture their _je ne sais quoi_. If you are familiar
with these games, I hope you caught a few references on the home page!

I also bookmarked a couple of other personal websites that caught my eye to use
as references:

- [Dead Simple Sites](https://deadsimplesites.com/) - lots of great examples
  here that encouraged me to simplify my design to just the essentials and avoid
  visual clutter.
- [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) - my holy grail of personal
  websites. I love the micro-interactions and easter eggs sprinkled all over
  while still keeping a simple and minimal look. I definitely took some notes
  from it.

# Iterations and Lessons Learned

I checked out some past commits to get a few snapshots of how the website
evolved over time. Let's start from the very beginning.

![Version 1 - January 21, 2023](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/230121.png)
Caption: Version 1 - January 21, 2023

Yes, really. üòÖ It was just my name and a link to my GitHub against a black
background. This was mostly me getting a domain, setting up a new project in
Next.js, and getting _something_ out there as a start.

Still the same content plus a footer, but this was when I established the
(original) look and feel. I went for a design that incorporates trendy design
patterns like blurs, gradient text and backgrounds, and spring animations. It
had a bit of an Apple product marketing page vibe but it didn't really connect
with me for my personal website and I didn't expand on it much more.

This was also around when the App Router in Next.js became GA and I migrated to
it from the Pages Router which was trivial since I only had a basic layout and
one page.

![Version 3 - April 4, 2024](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/240404.png)
Caption: Version 3 - April 4, 2024

Here I started experimenting with redesigning the look and feel and eventually
landed on the retro video-game inspired design. It was still just the hero and
footer; no content or fancy animations yet.

A big mistake I made at this point was migrating to [Vite](https://vite.dev/).
My reasoning was that I wouldn't use most features of Next.js that are geared
towards full-stack applications with dynamic content since I was just building a
static site. What I didn't account for was that I _did_ benefit greatly from
Next.js' ability to generate a
[static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/static-exports). To explain
this a bit better, let's get some acronym soup out of the way.

- **Single Page Application (`SPA`)** - your typical client-side application
  built with tools like Vite that runs entirely on one HTML page. All of its
  routing is faked with JS replacing the content of the page.
- **Static Site Generation (`SSG`)** - a technique where the application's pages
  or routes are compiled **at build time** to static HTML pages. It's supported
  by frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby, Astro, etc. This is what this website uses
  right now.
- **Server Side Rendering (`SSR`)** - similar to SSG but pages are compiled **at
  request time**. This still has the benefit of producing static HTML, but it
  also allows for dynamic content like a user's name and avatar or user-specific
  content. It requires a framework like Node.js that runs a server daemon.
- **Search Engine Optimization (`SEO`)** - an umbrella term for techniques that
  improve a website's visibility on search engines like Google.

I said it was a mistake to switch to Vite is because it only supports SPA and
[those are atrocious for SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)
(that's not entirely true and Vite
[does offer SSR and SSG capabilities](https://vite.dev/guide/ssr) but with a
low-level API that requires extra tooling and isn't exactly first-class). As a
result, I had to use the hash router, and my app's URLs looked like this:

`https://shevtsod.com/#/blog`

The silly little `/#/`
[made search engines refuse to crawl my website entirely](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hash_routing).
üíÄ

That's not to say that Vite is bad and I have used it (and the legacy Create
React App) for SPAs, but for a personal website, I definitely needed SSG
instead. I ended up migrating _back_ to Next.js which was overall a huge waste
of time but a good lesson to learn.

And that brings us to where we are today! ü•≥ Once I settled on a tech stack, got
the configuration just right (which for some reason always seems to take the
longest time), and got a surge of motivation, I was off to the races. From here,
most of the website was built on weekends from April to August 2025.

# The Tech Stack

Here is the tech stack I settled on for the project:

| Name                                                      | Purpose                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (w/ App Router)**        | React framework                                                |
| **[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)**                  | Styling (+ some CSS modules sprinkled in for more complex CSS) |
| **[Motion](https://motion.dev/)**                         | Fancy animations!                                              |
| **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)**                             | Markdown for blog posts like this one                          |
| **[giscus](https://giscus.app/)**                         | Comments for blog posts powered by GitHub                      |
| **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** | Continuous Integration and Delivery                            |
| **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**             | Hosting the static site                                        |
| **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)**                | Testing components in isolation                                |

So far, this works quite well and covers all my needs! üëç

# Design Principles

I've been careful to stick to a few rules that guided my design. You may have
noticed some examples of these on the website if I did a good job.

- üé® **Colour and Contrast**
  - I love [chiaroscuro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro) and mixing
    bold, vibrant colours against dark backgrounds. I think it looks amazing on
    modern OLED displays. **Signalis** does this masterfully and my theme is
    heavily influenced by it.
- ‚òØÔ∏è **Alignment, Balance, Negative Space, Proximity, and Repetition**
  - I try to express the UI without using explicit borders or separators which
    means bringing similar elements together and keeping dissimilar elements
    further apart and relying on the negative space between them instead.
- üì± **Responsive & Mobile First**
  - In 2025, every website should scale to any device size.
- üïπÔ∏è **Engaging Content**
  - Less walls of text and more visuals and micro-interactions.
- ü¶ã **Look and Feel**
  - Establish a theme and stick to it. I built custom components for buttons,
    icons, form fields, etc. so that nothing feels generic or out of place.
- üòä **Minimalism**
  - Less is more!
- üöó **Animation**
  - Animation is tough because its inclusion helps attract attention and
    interest but overuse leads to frustration. I took care to use it sparingly
    and keep animations short and sweet but still noticeable which took a lot of
    trial-and-error.

# Techniques and Tricks

Now I'll deep dive into a few specific features of the website and share some of
the techniques I used.

## Boot Sequence

![Boot Sequence](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/boot.png)

Would I ever force a 2 second splash screen on an actual website or application
if it wasn't necessary to cover loading? Never. Would I do it to make a first
impression on my personal website? Absolutely.

What was your reaction the first time you saw the boot sequence? I love it
because it's so attention grabbing, but I won't lie that I was scared of people
clicking off thinking the website is a virus or something. Fast moving terminal
text can have that effect. I still kept it because it's a unique touch and fits
my theme so well.

I couldn't find a name for this trope
([Activation Sequence](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActivationSequence),
[Diegetic Interface](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiegeticInterface)?)
but I noticed a lot of games, especially ones that try to go for a retro feel,
include a fake operating system boot sequence with references to some
in-universe brand/company. This shows up in both **Signalis** and **Metal Gear
Solid 2**. This was the perfect opportunity to introduce my very own **shevtsod
Corporation** and **shevtsodOS**!

<div className="full-width two-columns">
  <YouTubeEmbed videoId="XJPqmHEjkjE" params="start=92&end=135" />
  <YouTubeEmbed videoId="QygyxIlfDlw" params="end=20" />
</div>

There's a bit of randomization in the time before each line appears that makes
it feel a bit more authentic, like it's actually loading. One little detail you
may have missed is that the browser tab's title goes through a little boot
sequence too. Check it out again at [shevtsod.com](https://shevtsod.com)!

## Theme & Dark Mode

<div className="full-width two-columns">

![Mobile](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/mobile.png)
Caption:Mobile view

![Light](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/light.png)
Caption:Light theme

</div>

Tailwind makes both of these super easy, but I still put in a few extra touches
to optimize the experience for different themes and screen sizes:

- The default theme is selected based on your operating system setting.
- The selected theme is remembered for subsequent visits.
- The theme change fades in instead of changing abruptly.
- Certain UI elements (code blocks, transitions between sections, background
  images for sections) have light and dark variants.
- Some sections like [Contact](#contact) stay the same across themes where it
  makes sense.
- Many elements have multiple breakpoints (e.g., 1 column on mobile, 2 on
  tablets, 3 on desktop, etc.)
- On larger devices with more space, the table of contents in blog posts gets
  pinned to the side.

I have [another blog post](./250821-nextjs-ah-fouc) that goes into detail about
how to implement dark mode in Next.js and gotchas.

## Orchestrating Animations

There's not much to this really, I just used basic CSS keyframe animations and
some magic numbers to queue animations like those in the [Hero](#hero).

```css:hero.module.css
.title.intro {
  animation-name: fade, titleShine;
  animation-duration: 2.5s, 10s;
  animation-timing-function: steps(4, end), steps(60, end);
  animation-delay: 1s, 6s;
  animation-iteration-count: 1, infinite;
  animation-direction: normal, normal;
  animation-fill-mode: both, forwards;
}

.chevron.intro {
  animation-name: fade, blink;
  animation-duration: 1s, 2s;
  animation-timing-function: steps(1, end), steps(1, end);
  animation-delay: 6s, 7s;
  animation-direction: normal, normal;
  animation-fill-mode: backwards, none;
  animation-iteration-count: 1, infinite;
}
```

I also added styles based on component state in a few places for some more
control. Shoutout to [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) that
makes applying conditional styles so easy!

```tsx:hero.tsx
import styles from './hero.module.css';

export default function Hero () {
  const intro = useIntro();

  return (
    <h1
      className={classNames(
        'text-[6em]',
        // add title class from hero.module.css
        styles.title,
        // add intro class only if intro mode is enabled
        { [styles.intro]: intro },
      )}
    >
      Daniel Shevtsov
    </h1>
  )
}
```

If I did have any animations that are more complex, I would just use a library
like [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/documentation/) to truly orchestrate them.
You can do a lot without any libraries with just basic CSS, though, so why add
another dependency.

It was also very important to me to not bombard the user with animations. I
wanted to keep the [Boot Sequence](#boot-sequence) because of the first
impression it gives, but I also didn't want users to see it more than once. I
called this the "intro mode" and wanted to have a way to toggle it on and off.

Since my app uses SSG, every page is actually a different HTML page. It's a bit
tricky to maintain state across pages, but a really easy option is to just use
the URL. I simply check if there is a hash in the URL to disable the intro mode.
With the intro mode off, most transition animations are skipped.

- https://shevtsod.com ‚¨ÖÔ∏è intro animation plays
- https://shevtsod.com#top ‚¨ÖÔ∏è skips intro animation

This is why you only see the [Boot Sequence](#boot-sequence) once, and when you
click **Home** or **Contact** in the [Header](#header), you don't see it again.

The rest of the animations are just the fade-into-view kind that you've seen
everywhere. I implemented these using the
[`useInView`](https://motion.dev/docs/react-use-in-view) hook which is a wrapper
for
[`IntersectionObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
with a nicer API for React.

## Simulating Low Framerate

Retro games ran on very limited hardware
([and some developers used dark magic to make them run in the first place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTawyLNoRhU)).
Most consoles like the PS1 and PS2 ran at low framerates like at 30 frames per
second (FPS). As a result, you got choppy/stuttery animations that are
associated with games of that era.

I wanted to replicate this in my website, but funnily enough, with modern
hardware and high refresh-rate monitors, you have to go out of your way and
actually put effort into making animations look choppy on purpose.

Introducing the
[`steps()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function/steps)
timing function.

![The steps() function](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/angel.jpg)
Caption: The angelic `steps()` function descends

`steps()` lets us "control" the smoothness or choppiness of the animation. To
put it another way, if we have an animation that runs for 1 second and we use
`steps(30, end)`, we are essentially simulating that animation running at 30
FPS. The diagram below illustrates the difference between `steps()` and other
timing functions like `linear`.

![linear vs steps timing functions](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/steps.png)
Caption: `linear` vs `steps` timing functions

Here's a practical example:

<div className="full-width">
  <div
    className="codepen"
    data-height="600"
    data-default-tab="result,css"
    data-slug-hash="bNVXvKM"
    data-pen-title="simulating-low-framerate"
    data-user="shevtsod"
    data-editable="true"
  />
  <Script src="https://public.codepenassets.com/embed/index.js" />
</div>

The **NORMAL** circle objectively has better animation, but imagine how out of
place a buttery smooth 60+ FPS animation looks against some pixel art. On the
other hand, a `steps()` transition looks a lot more immersive. It's kinda like
how movie directors refuse to shoot above 24 FPS and despise motion
interpolation in modern TVs.

I used `steps()` transitions all over the place but strategically kept some
elements (like [Skills & Experience](#skills--experience)) running at high FPS
because I found that if _everything_ looks like it's animating slowly, it feels
like _the page itself_ is running slowly.

## Header

![Header](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/header.png)

The header is the primary navigation and contains the most critical links and
buttons. It supports two modes - It can either be shown/hidden after crossing a
scroll threshold or it can always be fixed to the top of the page, and this is
controllable per page. I hide it by default on the home page to put the
[Hero](#hero) center stage.

<div className="full-width">
  <img
    src="/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/logo-frames.png"
    className="w-full"
    alt="Logo sprite sheet"
  />
  Caption: The logo animation sprite sheet
</div>

The logo is actually animated! Look at it for a few seconds and it should do a
cool flip.

In the spirit of retro games, the logo animations come from the sprite sheet
above. This was a fun coincidence because storing images in sprite sheets also
happens to be a classic optimization for network bandwidth in web development.
My `Logo` component uses the finite-state machine (FSM) below to transition
between the three different animations contained in this sprite sheet and slides
through the frames to play each animation.

## Home

### Hero

![Hero](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/hero.png)

The hero section - the big, bold welcome screen at the top of a website whose
only job is to make an impact. First impressions are everything! This one is a
reference to title drops in many retro games. Specifically, mine is inspired by
the opening intro of **Pok√©mon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald**.

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="shUkq1sfSyU" params="start=47&end=72" />

The subtle 3D text effect and shine rolling over it made me really want to
recreate it, and this section was the perfect fit. I did tone down the flashing
colours a bit - Pok√©mon has a bit of a bad history with that.

The effect is really simple - it's just a combination of
`transform: perspective()` for the 3D effect and a very specific
`background: linear-gradient()` for that sharp glossy shine.

<div className="full-width">
  <div
    className="codepen"
    data-height="600"
    data-default-tab="result,css"
    data-slug-hash="MYaZgwY"
    data-pen-title="hero"
    data-user="shevtsod"
    data-editable="true"
  />
  <Script src="https://public.codepenassets.com/embed/index.js" />
</div>

Oh, and that little `SCROLL!` is inspired by the `GO!` indicator in beat'em ups
when you clear a room. üòÑ

### Summary

![Summary](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/summary.png)

This section is just a (hopefully accurate) summary of myself in three
paragraphs.

The background is pixel art that I made inspired by **Mega Man Battle Network**.
Its overworld and battles had these repeating, scrolling backgrounds reminiscent
of clip art on websites in the 90s. I used the
[`useScroll()`](https://motion.dev/docs/react-use-scroll) hook to give it a bit
of a parallax effect so it looks like it's further back on the page and it
starts scrolling the other way when you scroll up.

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="9CpoJDicwn4" params="start=8&end=26" />

### Skills & Experience

![Skills](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/skills.png)

After the [Summary](#summary), we go into a bit more detail with my resume. The
skills are displayed in responsive grids, and my work experience is displayed as
a timeline which I think is just intuitive.

All of the icons are pixel art handcrafted by yours truly!

### Projects

![Projects](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/projects.png)

My favourite section! It feels like a display window of my highlighted projects
with a large video/image demo for each. For just this section, I removed the
side margins to give the previews more screen real estate. I have a frosted
glass effect covering all but the closest project to the center of the screen to
draw focus to one of them at a time.

One thing I forgot to mention is that the actual content in this section (and
the previous sections) is not hardcoded in the components but stored in config
files, so I can easily update them later in my career without digging into the
code.

```ts:src/content/projects.ts
const projects: ProjectType[] = [
  {
    title: 'Personal Website',
    description:
      'This website, inspired by retro video games, was built to showcase projects and skills and includes a personal blog',
    promo: {
      path: '/videos/projects/480p/personal-website.mp4',
      type: 'video',
    },
    skills: ['nextjs', 'react', 'github', 'github-actions'],
    links: [
      {
        key: 'website',
        url: 'https://shevtsod.com',
      },
      {
        key: 'repository',
        url: 'https://github.com/shevtsod/shevtsod.github.io',
      },
    ],
  },
  // ...
];
```

### Contact

![Contact](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/contact.png)

A thinly veiled contact form! I hope it's obvious that this one is straight out
of **Metal Gear Solid**. I just recreated the codec call pixel art but with my
own theme colours and replaced Snake and the colonel with my own mug and your
mysterious anonymous face. A few carefully timed CSS animations let me show the
"CALL" notification and a quick call to action that looks like a message from me
to you.

## Blog

<div className="full-width two-columns">

![Blog Post](/images/blog/250919-how-its-made-personal-website/blog-post.png)

</div>

I wanted to have my very own blog for a long time, and I finally get to have
one! It's powered by [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and I find it extremely powerful
to be able to write blog posts (like this one!) in the lightweight Markdown
syntax but still have the flexibility to insert any custom JSX including any
React component. I don't think I'd have this much **power** on any other
existing platform.

A few of my favourite features of the blog are:

- the reading progress bar that gets added to the header.
- the ability to embed just about any content and make it look perfect.
- using frontmatter to set blog post metadata, set a hero image, and publish
  posts.

  ```md:blog-post.mdx

  ```

- code blocks like the one above that were a perfect chance to re-use my
  pixelated skills icons!

# Next Steps

It's never _perfect_ and I'm always making small tweaks, but a couple of larger
features I'd like to add at some point include:

- an RSS feed and a sitemap.
- search/filter blog posts by tags.
- a more sophisticated image component with a "maximize" button.
- dive into [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and add some low-poly PS1-era 3D
  graphics.

And that's it! Thanks for stopping by, and let me know your thoughts in the
comments below.
